# MYOB IT Challenge Submission 2016

## Introduction
For this submission, our team created a web solution that helped small businesses with HR. The purpose of this program was to analyse the sentiment of employees, as well as give valuable insight into workplace morale. The majority of this project was completed in a week and designed primarily as a prototype.

## Interface
The program UI was designed using the help of Bootstrap. Most of the colour palette was designed in reference to the colour codes used on the MYOB platform. Firstly, employees logged into the admin panel and are presented with tasks to complete. Employees are able to leave comments on how they felt the task was. Admins and managers have access to the analytics generated by the Sentiment Analyser.

## Cakebot
Cakebot is the name for the Sentiment Analysis program. The main task of this program is to analyse employee comments and pull important keywords. These are then graphed on a table, as well as providing a plot for the performance of the keyword over time. The main toolkit used for this program was NLTK.
